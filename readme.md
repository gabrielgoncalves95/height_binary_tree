### Tree: Height of a Binary Tree

#### Function Description

Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.

getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):

- root: a reference to the root of a binary tree.

##### Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

#### Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the tree.
Next line contains n space separated integer where i'th integer denotes node[i].data.

##### Note: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.

#### Constraints
- 1 <= node.data[i] <= 20
- 1 <= n <= 20

#### Output Format

Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

#### Input Example
```
7
3 5 2 1 4 6 7
```

#### Output Example
```
3
```
